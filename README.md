## 📈 Past Projects
### Data Science:
#### 1. [Histopathology Metastasis Detection](https://github.com/LilaNguyen/Metastasis-Tissue-Classification)
- **What I Did:**
  * Built 5+ ML models to classify histopathology images as metastasis or non-metasis
  * Evaluated and compared their performances in metastasis tissue detection using accuracy, AUC, ROC curves, and confusion matrices.
- **Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook
- **Result:** Achieved up to 81.6% test accuracy and 0.897 AUC with Random Forest model.

#### 2. [Sephora Analytics for Community Engagement-Driven Marketing](https://github.com/LilaNguyen/Skinterest-Tech-1B/tree/main)
- **What We Did:**
  * Analyzed [Sephora's skincare product and review dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nadyinky/sephora-products-and-skincare-reviews/data) to extract actionable marketing insights through community segmentation and trend analysis.
  * Insights are about: overall top brands, distribution of skin types, product reccomendation, and community clusters and their respective top ingredients and brands.
- **Tools:** Python, Google Colab
- **Results:**
  * Our supervised neural network using Stochastic Gradient Descent optimization algorithm and Binary Cross-Entropy for the loss function achieved 93.3% accuracy with 0.17 loss.
  * Our unsupervised K-Modes Clustering achieved the following: Silhouette: 0.081, Calinski-Harabasz: 137.985, Davies-Bouldin: 3.292, ARI: 0.003, NMI: 0.019, Homogeneity: 0.022, Completeness: 0.017, V-measure: 0.019

#### 3. [deep-learning-applications](https://github.com/LilaNguyen/deep-learning-applications)
- **What I Did:** Applied deep learning techniques and built 3+ neural networks (NN) to predict student final exam scores, classify individuals as having a sleep disorder or not, and predict whether a meal is healthy or not (from 3 different Kaggle datasets).
- **Tools:** Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
- **Results:** Achieved a
  * loss of 7.40 and MAE of 2.33 on exam scores with regression NN on [student academics dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saadaliyaseen/analyzing-student-academic-trends)
  * loss of 0.26 and 92.9% accuracy with binary classification NN on [lifestyle and sleep patterns dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/minahilfatima12328/lifestyle-and-sleep-patterns)
  * loss of 0.11 and 95.5% accuracy with binary classification NN on [healthy eating dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikyad001/healthy-eating-dataset/data).
  
#### 4. [Adult Census Income Prediction](https://github.com/LilaNguyen/Adult-Census-Income-Prediction)
- **What I Did:** Built 2 end-to-end ML models to predict income bracket of a new adult.
- **Tools:** Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
- **Results:** Built Logistic Regression and Random Forest models with 84% and 85% accuracy respectively.

#### 5. Ejection Fraction Prediction
- **What We Did:** Cleaned and transformed heart failure clinical data, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key relationships, and developed multiple linear regression models—including interaction effects—to predict ejection fraction.
- **Tools:** JMP
- **Results:**
  * Built 3+ regression models with actionable insights into predictors’ impact on heart function.
  * Collaborated with a team of 4 to produce a comprehensive report with variable interpretations, summary statistics, and visualizations.

### Full-stack:
#### 1. [Flavor Feed](https://github.com/jonehthan/Flavor-Feed)
- **What I Did:**
  * Owned backend development, implementing user authentication, authorization, and core app logic.
  * Built RESTful API endpoints to support CRUD operations, admin moderation, and user interactions.
  * Integrated and extended relational DB schema to support new features. Implemented notifications, replies, and content-sharing workflows.
- **Tools:** Python, Flask, MySQL, Git
- **Result:** Delivered a fully functional, database-driven recipe-sharing application, using RESTful architecture to secure user authentication and allow scalable content management.

#### 2. [Stock Price Analyzer](https://github.com/xiaoqilee/stock-market)
- **What I Did:**
  * Performed preprocessing and validation (i.e. handling missing values).
  * Computed summary statistics (i.e. mean, max, min closing price) using Pandas and NumPy
  * Created the line plots of stock trends using Matplotlib.
  * Displayed summary statistics and visualization in a readable format
- **Tools:** Python, Tkinter
- **Result:** Collaborated with Qi to design and implement a Python interface that could obtain, analyze, and visualize stock market trends from Yahoo Finance's API. 

#### 3. [Budget Buddy](https://github.com/LilaNguyen/budget-buddy#)
